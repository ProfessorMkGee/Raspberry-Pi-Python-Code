#illegal variables --> Why do these not work???
#2myvar = "John" #numbers are no good in variable names
#my-var = "John" #hyphens are not good!
#my var = "John" #spacing is no good according python

#unpack a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#set x to apple
#set y to banana
#set z to cherry
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)



#Python Numbers
x = 1    # int - whole number
y = 2.8  # float - deals with decimals
z = 1j   # complex - can be symbolic

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
